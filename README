This code is not perfectly engineered bacause was developed for research purpose.
You are welcome to submit pull requests if you extend it or you find and correct any bug.


Requirements
-----

* C++08 compiler (actually used gcc/g++ 4.8.1)
* OpenCv 2.4.* with Qt 4 support enabled
* gnuplot installed on the system.

Some helper functions in rbmUtils rely on unix API to call gnuplot.
You can exclude the code that relies on them just removing from the source code the display of the weight histogram.


Usage
-----

> tar -xzvf data.tar.gz
> make clean && make
> ./demo

The program uses graphical interface to show the bases and the distribution of the weights.

PS. When asked to press keys, focus on the GUI.
